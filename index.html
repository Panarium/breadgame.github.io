        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Breadgame is a breadpunk tabletop roleplaying game about exploring a world changed by the discovery and activation of countless yeast strains with special properties.</p>
        <p>By the year 2000, a practical use had been found for yeast in nearly every industry. The world as we know it is in a state of unending change as different organizations used the yeasts to change technology and the way people interact with it. Meanwhile, creatures called Leavens rise throughout the world. Some of these Leavens live in peace with their own esoteric goals, but others could grow to have the potential to turn cities into dust. You play as a Baker - someone who attracts different strains of yeast and becomes one with them - allowing you to use the unique abilities each one provides.</p>
