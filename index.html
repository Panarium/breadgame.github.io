        <h3>What is Breadgame?</h3>
        <p>Breadgame is a breadpunk tabletop roleplaying game about exploring a world changed by the discovery and activation of countless yeast strains with special properties.</p>
        <p>By the year 2000, a practical use had been found for yeast in nearly every industry. The world as we know it is in a state of unending change as different organizations used the yeasts to change technology and the way people interact with it. Meanwhile, creatures called Leavens rise throughout the world. Some of these Leavens live in peace with their own esoteric goals, but others could grow to have the potential to turn cities into dust.</p>
        <p>In Breadgame, you play as a Baker - someone who attracts different strains of yeast and becomes one with them - allowing you to use the unique abilities each one provides. The more you develop as a Baker, the more tools you will have to shape the ever-changing and chaotic world you’re in.</p>

        <h3>The Leavening Day</h3>
        <p>01-01-2000 was the Leavening Day, when mass amounts of yeast were activated after lying dormant - some for centuries. Locations with high concentrations of yeast allowed for the development and rise of yeast-based lifeforms called “Leavens.” </p>
        <p>As countless new yeast strains were activated, some would begin to interact strangely with those that had been force-activated by various organizations. Some yeast-technology made before 2000 would cease to work, but some reacted to the new yeasts in ways that could be incredibly dangerous.</p>
        <p>At this same time, thousands of Bakers around the world started attracting newly activated yeasts because of the natural Starters in their blood. These powers give Bakers the best chance anyone has at withstanding the worst things to come from the Leavening.</p>
